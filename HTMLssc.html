The temple's design was inspired by the lotus flower – the national flower of India. Engineers constructed the <br />building out of 27 'leaves'. Each leaf is a marble-clad free-standing concrete slab. There are 3 sorts of leaf making<br />up the temple. The temple is constructed from marble, cement and sand. The 27 petals were clad with marble from <br />Rajasthani Macrana, the dolomite clay is from the mines of Alwar, near Delhi, and the white silica sand is from <br />Jaipur.

KaalBhairava wandered along the banks of River Ganga southwards. At a certain position, the river turned towards <br />North and he entered Kashi. When he dipped his left hand in the river, the head unclung from his hand and he was <br />liberated. This place became Kashi as told by the legend. Kashi Vishwanath’s temple is made of Gold Spire and Gold<br />Dome.
